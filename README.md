# Discord-custom-presence

---

> **_NOTE:_** This program do not actually works, still WIP

This is a little program that allows you to manage your discord activity.

## MVP

- [ ] Make a small/simple ui with QT including :
  - [ ] An image entry
  - [x] A title entry
- [x] Send this to discord via pypresence

## Here is a little mockup
It should looks like this at the end. Much more informations and settings in the right pannel then.
